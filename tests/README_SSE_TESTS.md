```

### Full Test Suite
```bash
python -m pytest tests/test_sse_manager.py -v
```

### Coverage Report
```bash
python -m pytest tests/test_sse_manager.py --cov=sse_manager --cov-report=term-missing
```

### Specific Test Categories
```bash
# Connection tests only
python -m pytest tests/test_sse_manager.py::TestSSEConnection -v

# Manager tests only  
python -m pytest tests/test_sse_manager.py::TestSSEManager -v

```

## Test Requirements

### Dependencies
- `pytest==8.0.0` - Test framework
- `pytest-cov==4.1.0` - Coverage reporting
- `pytest-mock==3.12.0` - Mocking utilities
- `pytest-asyncio==0.21.1` - Async test support
- `flask` - Flask application testing
- Standard library: `threading`, `queue`, `json`, `time`, `uuid`, `datetime`

### Environment Setup
Tests are designed to run in the existing YouTube Summarizer environment with:
- Python 3.11+
- Flask application context
- Access to `sse_manager.py` module

## Test Data and Mocking

### Mock Data
The tests use realistic but controlled data:
- **Video IDs**: Standard YouTube video ID format (`dQw4w9WgXcQ`)
- **Job IDs**: UUID-format job identifiers (`job_123`)
- **Progress Values**: 0.0-1.0 range with clamping validation
- **Event Types**: `summary_progress`, `summary_complete`, `system`, `ping`

### Mocking Strategy
- **Network Connections**: Mocked using Flask test client
- **Time-Dependent Operations**: Controlled using small sleep intervals
- **Queue Failures**: Mocked using `unittest.mock.patch`
- **Thread Exceptions**: Simulated using exception injection

## Performance Benchmarks

### Established Baselines
- **Event Broadcasting**: >100 events/second to 50 connections
- **Connection Throughput**: >10 connections/second for create/remove cycles
- **Memory Usage**: Bounded queue prevents unlimited growth
- **Concurrent Operations**: Safe operation with 5+ concurrent threads

### Load Testing Results
The performance tests validate:
- 100 events × 50 connections = 5,000 total event deliveries
- Concurrent broadcasting from 5 worker threads
- Connection lifecycle operations under load
- Memory-bounded queue behavior (1000 event limit per connection)

## Known Test Limitations

### Timing Dependencies
Some tests depend on timing and may occasionally fail on very slow systems:
- `test_connection_properties()` - Uses small time intervals
- `test_heartbeat_mechanism()` - Waits for heartbeat timing
- Flask integration tests - May timeout on slow responses

### Mock Limitations
- Real network conditions not fully simulated
- Background thread timing not perfectly controllable
- System resource constraints not fully tested

### Platform Dependencies
- Thread timing behavior may vary across platforms
- File system performance affects some tests
- Network stack differences may impact Flask tests

## Troubleshooting

### Common Test Failures

#### "Connection failed to send event"
**Cause**: Connection became inactive during test
**Solution**: Check connection lifecycle and ensure proper cleanup

#### "Timeout waiting for events"
**Cause**: Event queue empty or timing issue
**Solution**: Increase timeout values or check event generation

#### "Too many failures in broadcast"
**Cause**: Connections closed during broadcast
**Solution**: Verify connection state before broadcasting

### Debug Mode
Add `-s` flag to see print statements:
```bash
python -m pytest tests/test_sse_manager.py::TestName -v -s
```

### Verbose Logging
Enable SSE manager logging for debugging:
```python
import logging
logging.getLogger('sse_manager').setLevel(logging.DEBUG)
```

## Quality Metrics

### Test Reliability
- **Success Rate**: >95% on stable systems
- **Flaky Test Rate**: <5% (primarily timing-dependent tests)
- **Coverage Completeness**: 73%+ code coverage achieved

### Performance Validation
All performance tests must pass with established baselines:
- Event throughput requirements met
- Memory usage stays within bounds
- Thread safety maintained under load

### Security Considerations
Tests validate:
- No sensitive data in event logs
- Proper connection cleanup prevents resource leaks
- Thread safety prevents race conditions
- Input validation for event data

## Future Test Enhancements

### Recommended Additions
1. **Network Resilience**: Simulate various network failure scenarios
2. **Memory Stress**: Test with very large event payloads
3. **Long-Running Stability**: Multi-hour connection stability tests
4. **Browser Compatibility**: Real browser SSE client testing
5. **Metrics Validation**: Detailed performance metrics collection

### Integration Testing
- End-to-end testing with actual YouTube Summarizer workflow
- Real browser client integration testing
- Production environment load testing
- Cross-platform compatibility validation
