## New File Created

### `/static/css/theme-integration.css`
**Purpose:** Comprehensive CSS styles for all dynamically created theme-aware elements

**Features:**
- Enhanced SSE status indicators with theme-consistent styling
- Progress containers with theme-aware borders and colors
- Toast notifications with proper theme integration
- Connection status indicators with theme-consistent states
- Async integration notifications with theme support
- Responsive design for mobile devices

**Key Style Classes:**
- `.enhanced-sse-status` - SSE connection status with theme variants
- `.async-progress-container` - Progress tracking with status colors
- `.async-toast` - Toast notifications with theme borders
- `.async-notification` - General notifications with theme support
- `.connection-status-dot` - Connection indicators with theme colors
- Theme variants: `.theme-light`, `.theme-dark` for all components

## Theme Integration Architecture

### Event System
- All JavaScript files listen for `'theme-changed'` custom events
- Event contains `currentEffectiveTheme` property with resolved theme
- Automatic theme detection using `data-theme` attribute
- Fallback to 'light' theme when attribute is missing

### Dynamic Element Updates
- Each file implements theme update methods for their specific elements
- Real-time theme switching without page refresh
- Batch updates for improved performance
- Consistent theme application across all components

### CSS Variable Integration
- All dynamic elements use CSS custom properties
- Seamless integration with main theme system
- Support for color scheme preferences
- Accessibility features (high contrast, reduced motion)

## Testing Considerations

### Manual Testing Required:
1. **Theme Switching**: Verify all dynamic elements update when theme changes
2. **Progress Bars**: Test progress bar theme consistency during async operations
3. **Notifications**: Verify toast and notification theme consistency
4. **Connection Status**: Test SSE connection indicators with theme changes
5. **Mobile Responsiveness**: Test theme integration on mobile devices
6. **Accessibility**: Test with high contrast and reduced motion preferences

### Integration Points:
- Theme toggle button should trigger updates across all dynamic elements
- SSE connection status should maintain theme consistency
- Progress bars should update theme during active operations
- Notifications should appear with correct theme immediately

## Browser Compatibility
- Modern browsers with EventSource support
- CSS custom properties support
- Modern JavaScript (ES6+) features
- Media queries for responsive design and accessibility

## Performance Optimizations
- Event delegation for theme change listeners
- Batch DOM updates for theme changes
- Efficient CSS class toggling
- Minimal DOM queries with caching where appropriate

## Accessibility Features
- High contrast mode support
- Reduced motion preferences
- Proper color contrast ratios
- Screen reader friendly markup
- Semantic HTML in dynamic elements

## Security Considerations
- XSS protection through HTML escaping
- Safe DOM manipulation practices
- Secure event handling
- No inline JavaScript in dynamic content

## Future Enhancements
- Animation preferences detection
- Theme transition animations
- Custom theme color support
- Enhanced accessibility features
- Performance monitoring for theme updates

## Integration with Existing System
This implementation seamlessly integrates with:
- Phase 1 Theme Manager system
- Existing async worker system
- Current SSE implementation
- Existing UI components
- Mobile responsive design
- Accessibility standards

All dynamic elements now participate in the theme system while maintaining full functionality and backward compatibility.
